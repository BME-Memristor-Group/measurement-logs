## 2024.02.01. Julich smaples, third measurement - Matteo, Zoli

### Recreate the measurement made yesterday.
- IV_Block 5 looking stable, higher current amplifier makes less noise on the stable measurements., IV6 is with higher 1e6 current amplifier. 
Noise:
- Card offset -0.090654 mV , Agilent offset:0.269617 mV
- Start measuring with an IV. Noise, IV, SET, IV Noise, IV RESET.
- IV is looking good. Start Noise. Restart because didnt switched the capacitor. the first HRS iv's bottom is around -2e-6 A, and the LRS is around -4e-6 A at 1 V. The HRS after the noise is slightly higher at -3e-6 A. Noise on LRS. Restart because didnt switched the capacitor.
- From the evaluatioin we see that 1V is making the sample switch. Next time will measre with fix LCA.
