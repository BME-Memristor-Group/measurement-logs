### Conductive AFM setup.
- tried measurement with C40.4, which worked for 10-20 measurements. IV1-8. AFter that we tried to format it with 1.5V, when the current amplifier went overload. Switched to 1e4 from 1e6 and no further measurements were possible. Tried to get contact while measureing the surface. It went to error after 1/4 of the 20x20 micrometer part. The error was Tip Guard Decel. Probably killed the cantilever. Sending it to diagnostics with Gerg≈ë. Changeing to C40.5.
- Successful contact on P08p50 with C.AFM. IV 28-29. Stbility of 1V 10s, at IV 30. Lost contact at 1V 10s. Switched gain from 1e6 to 1e4. 40-41-42 is getting the signal back. The noise is more. The signal died again. Tried to raise the Force Setpoint to 100 and 150 from 50.
- Change C40.5 (probably died) to C12. Switched from PCMO MT1 to golden sheet. C12 didnt went overload on 1V 10s. Switched to C13. No contact. After investigation the plate, we see that it could move. We fixed it. The bnc cables inner wire was not maintained, so we pulled out the wire by hand. The conducting was semi-success. The conducted state is not stable, and low chance that we can see the linear curve. Otherwise it's not conducted. We shouldnt press the cantilever with higher Force Setpoint. It was good and stable at 1 nN.
